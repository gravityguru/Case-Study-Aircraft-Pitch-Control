Case study carried out to analyze longitudinal dynamics and longitudinal equations of motion for the aircraft are considered.


Case Study:  Aircraft Pitch Control

•	To analyse longitudinal dynamics.

•	the longitudinal equations of motion for the aircraft are considered.

Assumptions:

•	Aircraft is in steady-cruise at constant altitude and velocity; thus, the thrust, drag, weight and lift forces balance each other in the x- and y-directions
•	a change in pitch angle will not change the speed of the aircraft,

•	input will be the elevator deflection angle ‘delta’ and putput is pitch angle ‘q’ of the aircraft.

Analysis Carried out:

•	Open Loop Response, Closed loop response, PID Controller Design, Controller Design using root-locus approach, LQR Design, Controller Design Via. Pole placement techniques.
Tools Used to implement:

MATLAB, Simulink, Flightgear.
